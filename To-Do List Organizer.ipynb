This project, ideal for those familiar with Python basics, introduces key concepts like handling user inputs, performing arithmetic operations, and mastering basic file handling. It's not just about coding; it's about creating a tool that brings practical value to your everyday life.\n","\n","Objective:\n","\n","The goal is to create a user-friendly application that efficiently tracks daily expenses and offers insightful summaries of spending patterns.\n","\n","Features:\n","\n","Add Expense: The application prompts users to input the date, expense category (such as food, transport, or utilities), and the amount spent. This feature is fundamental for recording daily expenditures.\n","\n","View Expenses: Users can view their expenses filtered by a specific day, week, or month. This flexibility allows for a tailored review of spending habits.\n","\n","Expense Summary: This feature provides a comprehensive summary, categorizing and totaling expenses by each category. It's an excellent tool for gaining a clearer understanding of spending distribution.\n","\n","Data Storage: The application ensures data persistence across sessions by saving expense records to a file. This approach makes it easy to maintain and track financial data over time.\n","\n","Concepts to Learn:\n","\n","Variables and Data Types: Learn to utilize various data types to store critical information like dates, categories, and amounts.\n","\n","Control Structures: Implement loops and conditional statements to navigate the application's menu, process user inputs, and ensure data validation.\n","\n","Functions: Develop modular code by creating specific functions for adding, viewing, and summarizing expenses. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability.\n","\n","File Handling: Gain practical experience in reading from and writing to text or CSV files, a crucial skill for data persistence in applications.\n","\n","This project is not only about coding; it's an exercise in creating a practical, everyday tool while reinforcing your Python skills. It's ideal for those looking to apply their programming knowledge in real-world scenarios.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4xJpfxW0pIyX"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"id":"QSVYhLE6nmWI","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1705867502336,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":116700,"user":{"displayName":"N Gh","userId":"10042432189600252733"}},"outputId":"1c408884-5c0e-474a-85df-05997d9360ab"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","To-Do List Organizer\n","1.
