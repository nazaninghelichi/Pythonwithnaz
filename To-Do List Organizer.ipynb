As we progress in our Python journey, this application serves as an excellent tool for those familiarizing themselves with Python's fundamentals. It's not just about coding; it's about crafting a useful tool that aids in daily organization. This project introduces essential skills like handling user inputs, performing operations, and basic file handling in Python.\n","\n","Objective:\n","\n","The aim is to develop a Python application that effectively manages and organizes daily tasks, enhancing productivity and organization.\n","\n","Features:\n","\n","Add Task: Enable users to easily add new tasks, prompting for details like the task description and deadlines.\n","\n","View Tasks: Allow users to view their to-do list, providing a clear and concise display of all tasks, sorted by priority or deadline.\n","\n","Update Task: Implement a feature to modify existing tasks, whether it’s changing the task description or adjusting deadlines.\n","\n","Delete Task: Provide an option to remove tasks from the list, keeping the to-do list current and manageable.\n","\n","Data Storage: Store tasks in a file, ensuring that the list remains intact between sessions, and offering users a persistent, reliable task management system.\n","\n","Concepts to Learn:\n","\n","Variables and Data Types: Learn to use different data types to store task details and user inputs effectively.\n","\n","Control Structures: Employ loops and conditional statements for navigating through the application, processing inputs, and validating data.\n","\n","Functions: Develop functions for each feature (adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks), promoting code reusability and maintainability.\n","\n","File Handling: Gain experience in reading from and writing to files, a fundamental skill for data persistence in applications.\n","\n","This project is a perfect blend of learning and practical utility, ideal for those who want to see their coding skills come to life in everyday tools. It's not just about writing code; it's about creating something that helps organize and simplify your daily routine."],"metadata":{"id":"IDYdixtGqKrH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"id":"QSVYhLE6nmWI","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1705867502336,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":116700,"user":{"displayName":"N Gh","userId":"10042432189600252733"}},"outputId":"1c408884-5c0e-474a-85df-05997d9360ab"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","To-Do List Organizer\n","1.
