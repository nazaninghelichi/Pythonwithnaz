Add Expense: Prompt the user to enter the date, category (e.g., food, transport, utilities), and expense amount.\n","2.  View Expenses: Display expenses for a particular day, week, or month.\n","3. Expense Summary: Give a summary of expenses, categorizing total spending by category.\n","4. Data Storage: Save the expense data to a file, allowing persistence between sessions.\n","\n","**Concepts to Learn:**\n","\n","\n","\n","*   Variables and Data Types: Use different types of variables to store dates, categories, and amounts.\n","*   Control Structures: Implement loops and conditional statements to navigate through the menu and validate user input.\n","* Functions: Create functions for adding, viewing, and summarizing expenses.\n","* File Handling: Read from and write to text files or CSV files to store the expense data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"O5_bnoE0wAcc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Function to add a new expense to the list\n","def add_expense(expenses):\n","    # Prompting user for expense details\n","    date = input(\"Enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD): \")  # Collecting date\n","    category = input(\"Enter the category: \")  # Collecting category\n","    amount = float(input(\"Enter the amount: \"))  # Collecting amount and converting it to float\n","\n","    # Creating a new expense entry as a dictionary\n","    new_expense = {\"date\": date, \"category\": category, \"amount\": amount}\n","\n","    # Appending the new expense to the expenses list\n","    expenses.append(new_expense)\n","\n","    # Confirmation message\n","    print(\"Expense added!\")\n","\n","# Function to view all expenses\n","def view_expenses(expenses):\n","    for expense in expenses:  # Looping through each expense\n","        # Printing out each expense detail\n","        print(f\"Date: {expense['date']}, Category: {expense['category']}, Amount: ${expense['amount']:.2f}\")\n","\n","# Function to summarize expenses by category\n","def summarize_expenses(expenses):\n","    summary = {}  # Dictionary to hold summary of expenses\n","    for expense in expenses:  # Looping through each expense\n","        # Summing amounts for each category\n","        category = expense['category']\n","        amount = expense['amount']\n","        if category in summary:\n","            summary[category] += amount\n","        else:\n","            summary[category] = amount\n","\n","    # Printing out summary information\n","    for category, amount in summary.items():\n","        print(f\"Total spent on {category}: ${amount:.2f}\")\n","\n","# Function to save expenses to a file\n","import csv\n","def save_expenses(expenses):\n","    with open('expenses.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:  # Opening file in write mode\n","        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=[\"date\", \"category\", \"amount\"])\n","        writer.writeheader()  # Writing headers\n","        writer.writerows(expenses)  # Writing expense data\n","    print(\"Expenses saved!\")\n","\n","# Function to load expenses from a file\n","def load_expenses():\n","    try:\n","        with open('expenses.csv', mode='r') as file:  # Opening file in read mode\n","            reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n","            return list(reader)  # Converting to list and returning\n","    except FileNotFoundError:  # Handling case where file doesn't exist\n","        return []  # Returning an empty list\n","\n","# Main function to run the expense tracker\n","def main():\n","    expenses = load_expenses()  # Loading existing expenses\n","\n","    # Infinite loop to continuously run the application\n","    while True:\n","        # Displaying user options\n","        print(\"\\n1.
